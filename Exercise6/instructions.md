# Instructions

You need to create an interactive calculator using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The calculator must be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on integers. The HTML and CSS code is already provided beforehand, so you must set up the JS functions which will allow the functionalities to function properly.

Here are the expected features:

* The calculator should display the numbers 0 to 9, as well as the addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) buttons;
* The user must be able to enter numbers by clicking on the number buttons;
* The user must be able to enter operations by clicking on the operation buttons;
* When the user clicks the equals button (`=`), the calculator should display the result of the operation;
* The user should be able to clear the entry by clicking the reset button (`C`).

You can use JavaScript events such as `onclick()` to handle button clicks and corresponding operations.
